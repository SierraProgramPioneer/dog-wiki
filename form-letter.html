<!-- Form Letter
Make a form letter where the user inputs their name, and they get back a letter addressed to them. Feel free to use lorem ipsum for the text of the letter. Use Bootstrap and your knowledge of CSS to make the letter look like a letter or virtual postcard. Use console.log() once â€” either to try it out or to debug an issue.

Optionally include this functionality as well:

A way to reset the form and letter by clearing those values/results.
A way for the user to create their own letter in response, addressed to you.
