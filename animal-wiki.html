<!-- Animal Wiki
Craft a site with information about turtles, snakes, and insects (or another three animals or items of your choosing).

The page should ask the user which animal they'd like to learn about. Use a form to gather which animal the user would like to see. For example, a user should input "turtle" into the form in order to see information about turtles.
When a user submits their selection through the form, display a div containing information about that animal (including a picture). All animal divs should be hidden except for the animal that the user has requested to see.
Include an else in your branching logic to handle incorrect form inputs â€” anything that does not match "turtle", "snake", and "insect" (or the names of the 3 animals/items you have chosen). When this happens, show an message to the user that states they've made an error in their input. -->
