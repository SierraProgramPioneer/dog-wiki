            <h2>Golden Retriever</h2>
            <p>The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gun dog (a type of hunting dog for soft-mouthed retrieving of fowl) and may be trained for use as a guide dog.</p>

<!-- Animal Wiki
Craft a site with information about turtles, snakes, and insects (or another three animals or items of your choosing).

The page should ask the user which animal they'd like to learn about. Use a form to gather which animal the user would like to see. For example, a user should input "turtle" into the form in order to see information about turtles.
When a user submits their selection through the form, display a div containing information about that animal (including a picture). All animal divs should be hidden except for the animal that the user has requested to see.
Include an else in your branching logic to handle incorrect form inputs — anything that does not match "turtle", "snake", and "insect" (or the names of the 3 animals/items you have chosen). When this happens, show an message to the user that states they've made an error in their input. -->
